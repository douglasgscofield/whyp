Who's Your Parent: Parentage Assignment
---------------------------------------

Whyp provides R functions for maximum-likelihood assignment of parentage of
progeny based on genotypes from progeny and/or progeny-associated maternal
tissue (e.g. pericarps), and genotypes of potential parents.  Whyp handles two
kinds of genotyping error: null alleles (common in maternal tissue), and
mistyping (completely wrong genotype).

Development of Whyp to date has focused on identifying the maternal parent.
