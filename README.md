Whyp (Who's Your Parent): Parentage Assignment
----------------------------------------------

Whyp provides R functions for maximum-likelihood assignment of parentage of
progeny based on genotypes from progeny and/or progeny-associated maternal
tissue (e.g. pericarps), and genotypes of potential parents.  Whyp handles two
kinds of genotyping error: null alleles (common in maternal tissue), and
mistyping (completely wrong genotype).

Development of whyp to date has focused on identifying the maternal parent.

The whyp API is very rough at this stage.  Genotype input for parents,
pericarps and progeny is each in the form of an annotated `data.frame` produced by
`readGenalex()` (available at <https://github.com/douglasgscofield/popgen>).

  `assemble.whyp.data()` : load data for a whyp run into a large list

  `whyp()` : calculate parental assignments

The file `example.R` contains some example code which uses these functions.  The data files themselves are not included.  `assemble.v1()` and `assemble.v2()` load data for a whyp run.  `whyp.analysis()` runs a whyp analysis on a loaded dataset, and includes alternatives for specifying an analysis and returning results.
